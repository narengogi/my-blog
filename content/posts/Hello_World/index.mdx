I have no idea how to begin writing this post, I've been writing 
and deleting whole lines for atleast half an hour. I am appraising
the reader of the my plight in joining words, for I am well aware of 
my ineptitude to converse and convey my thoughts clearly in real life.

The problem with human memory in my opinion, is that while it is amazing in it's ability
to record and store attributes separately to the tokens of information 
associated, the fidelity of reproduction unlike from mechanical memory is 
terribly poor. Whenever I try reminiscing some good memories, I always
feel limited by the capacity of my own mind. Surely, the photographs 
and video recordings help, but a memory is what you feed inside your 
loop box and accept as the passed state. In this regard, I've found that 
the entries in my personal diary produce quite a unique effect on the senses. 

I intend for this blog to serve as an extension of that general experiment.
