I know it sounds absurd, me saying that Iâ€™m taking a break from publishing posts, after only doing 3 of them on a half finished website.

Writing has always been a great source of joy for me, but for the most part, because the audience included none but myself, a wicked feedback loop developed, some sort of augean stables of ideas and memories. Without needless romanticization of the golden age of the internet, let me say, that midway between the trash that is social media, and the limitless expressive freedom of completely anonymized internet whiteboards, personal websites without analytics embedded are safe spaces with almost magical vibes. You revise and censure your posts, for an audience you cannot see, an audience whose general character is understood, yet are unknown.

Writing, to me, has become an activity that I associate with a chaotic state of mind. I need some time off this, to work on an undertaking single-mindedly. Until then.
